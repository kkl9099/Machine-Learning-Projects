🚀 Project Spotlight: Swimming Scholarship Enrollment Clustering 🏊‍♀️🎓
Swimming is a key sport for many students looking to secure college scholarships. Scholarship committees often need to evaluate swimming applicants based on factors such as academic performance, swimming performance in different styles, and other relevant attributes. Clustering can help understand different types of student segments, optimize scholarship offerings, and tailor support for specific student groups. This assignment focuses on three clustering techniques—K- Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering—to analyze and segment the swimming scholarship applicants.


Key Insights:
🧑‍🎓🏊‍♂️ Identified unique student segments based on academic performance and swimming abilities 
🔍 Used advanced clustering techniques to enhance scholarship offerings and optimize support tailored to student needs 🤝
📊 Analyzed features like swimming times, GPA, and years of competitive experience to generate actionable insights 
This project not only helped improve decision-making in scholarship allocations but also deepened my knowledge of machine learning, data preprocessing, and feature engineering.

📌 Key Takeaways:
K-Means provided clear segmentation of high-performing swimmers 🥇
DBSCAN helped identify density-based clusters, while Hierarchical clustering offered valuable exploratory insights 🔑

🔧 Tools Used: Python, Power BI, SQL, K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering
